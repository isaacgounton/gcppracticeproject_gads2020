Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

Overview

In this lab, you will create virtual machines (VMs) and connect to them. You will also create connections between the instances.

Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

    Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

    Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

    Connect between the two instances.

Task 1: Create a virtual machine using the Cloud Shell or gcloud SDK

1.	In the Cloud Console, click on "Activate Cloud Shell". Alternatively, you can use the gcloud SDK terminal if you have it installed on your local machine. 

2.	In the Cloud Shell Terminal, run the following command:

=> 	gcloud beta compute --project=qwiklabs-gcp-00-b4243037283c instances create my-vm-1 --zone=us-central1-a --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --subnet=default --tags=http-server --image=debian-9-stretch-v20200805 --image-project=debian-cloud --boot-disk-size=10GB --boot-disk-type=pd-standard --boot-disk-device-name=mv-vm-1

This command will create a VM instance "my-vm-1" in the specified project "qwiklabs-gcp-00-b4243037283c". The VM instance will be created in the "us-central1" region and "us-central1-a" zone. The VM machine type is "n1-standard-1 (1 vCPU, 3.75 GB memory)" and the default network and service account will be used. The image that will be used is the "debian-9-stretch-v20200805" with a boot disk sze of "10 GB".

=>	gcloud compute --project=qwiklabs-gcp-00-b4243037283c firewall-rules create default-allow-http --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=http-server

The above command creates a "default-allow-http" firewall rule on the default network in the project "qwiklabs-gcp-00-b4243037283c", with the direction "Ingress" and "allow" action. The priority is set to "1000" and it applied to resources with the target tag "http-server"

Task 2: Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line

1.	In the Cloud Console, click on "Activate Cloud Shell". Alternatively, you can use the gcloud SDK terminal if you have it installed on your local machine. 

2.	To display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you, enter this partial command "gcloud compute zones list | grep" followed by the region that Qwiklabs or your instructor assigned you to.

Your completed command will look like this:

=>	gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you. For example, if Qwiklabs assigned you to region us-central1 and zone us-central1-a you might choose zone us-central1-b.

3.	To set your default zone to the one you just chose, enter this partial command "gcloud config set compute/zone" followed by the zone you chose.

Your completed command will look like this:

=>	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

4.	To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:

=>	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

5.	To close the Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

=>	exit

Task 3: Connect between VM instances

1.	In cloud shell, use the command below to SSH into my-vm-2:

=>	gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

type and enter "y" if you're prompted

2.	Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

=>	ping my-vm-1

Notice that the output of the ping command reveals that the complete hostname of my-vm-1 is my-vm-1.c.PROJECT_ID.internal, where PROJECT_ID is the name of your Google Cloud Platform project. GCP automatically supplies Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution for the internal IP addresses of VM instances.

Press Ctrl+C to abort the ping command.

3.	Use the "exit" command to exit the my-vm-2 SSH session;

=>	exit

4.	To set the zone to the zone of my-vm-1, execute the following command:

=>	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

5.	SSH into my-vm-1:

=>	gcloud compute ssh my-vm-1

If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity, enter yes to confirm that you do.

6.	At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

=>	sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

7.	Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

=>	sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

8.	Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

=>	Hi from YOUR_NAME

9.	Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

10.	Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

=>	curl http://localhost/

The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

11.	To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

=>	exit

12.	To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, return to the command prompt on my-vm-2 and execute this command:

=>	curl http://my-vm-1/

The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

13.	Execute the following command to return details of my-vm-1. Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.

=>	gcloud compute instances describe mv-vm-1
